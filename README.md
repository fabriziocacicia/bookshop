# bookshop
POC of a Books Shop that showcase an AI Assisted Search filter

## Overview
The system consists of 3 components: a MongoDB database, a Flask backend and a React frontend.
The 3 components run separately in their own docker containers.

## Usage
The project is provided with `make` commands to easily start, stop and rebuild the containers.

Otherwise, it's possible to manually execute `docker-compose` commands on the `docker-compose.yml` file.
